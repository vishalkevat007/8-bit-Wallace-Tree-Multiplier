8-Bit Wallace Tree Multiplier and MAC Module
This repository contains the implementation of an 8-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier and a Multiply-and-Accumulate (MAC) module using 45nm CMOS technology in Cadence Virtuoso.

Features:
8-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier: Implemented using 4:2 compressors for partial product reduction and a final Carry Look-Ahead Adder to optimize the multiplication process.
MAC Module: The MAC module integrates the Wallace Tree Multiplier with a Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO) shift register acting as an accumulator. The accumulator is designed using D Flip-Flops for efficient storage of each bit's value.
The project aims to provide a high-speed and energy-efficient implementation of the Wallace Tree Multiplier and MAC unit suitable for applications in digital signal processing and other computational systems.

Technologies:
45nm CMOS technology
Cadence Virtuoso for schematic design and simulation
